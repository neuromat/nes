Questionnaires
==============

Questionnaires are a very flexible way to collect data from a participant. In NES, a questionnaire may or may not have required filling. Experiment questionnaires are configured as a step in the experimental protocol of a :ref:`group <group-of-participants>`. Questionnaires that haven't required filling are useful to collect data that are not foreseen in the :ref:`participant's section <participants>`. Any questionnaire can have both functions.
