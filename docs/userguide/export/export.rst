Export
======

Export is a way to transfer data from NES and LimeSurvey questionnaires (connected to NES) to files in "csv" (comma separated values) format. A zipped file is created with various types of data, like questionnaire, participant and diagnosis. 

Only users that have :ref:`permissions` to run export can see this option in the menu.

NES offers two types of exportation:

* :ref:`Per participant <export-participant-data>`
* :ref:`Per experiment <export-experiment-data>`

For each type of export, you can filter the group of participants whose data you want to export.

The participants can be filtered by gender, marital status, locations, diagnosis and age. As shows the picture below.
