.. _searching-a-participant:

Searching a Participant
-----------------------

In order to access participants registered at NES, click the `Participants` menu item and the `Search Participant` screen will show up. The best way to find a participant is either writing part of the name or Natural Persons Register number (CPF) and choose a name/CPF from the list that appears.

You can also insert a new participant, if you have permission to it (see :ref:`permissions` for more information), by clicking `Insert new` button. 

.. _viewing-a-participant:

Viewing a Participant
---------------------

After selecting a participant from the search result list, the participant's personal information is shown.

You may delete the participant if you have  the right permission. The `Delete` button will appear in this case (in red, at the bottom of the page), but won't appear if you are at the :ref:`edition mode <creating-and-editing-a-participant>`.

Participant information is divided in the following tabs:

* :ref:`personal-data`
* :ref:`social-demographic-data`
* :ref:`social-history`
* :ref:`medical-evaluation`
* :ref:`participant-questionnaires`

You can change from tab to tab in two different ways: either clicking the tab name or using the navigate buttons at the bottom-right of the screen.

With the right permissions, it is possible to delete the participant (red button).

Click the `Edit` button to change the participant's information.

.. _creating-and-editing-a-participant:

Creating and Editing a Participant
----------------------------------

If you click either the `Insert new` button of the :ref:`searching-a-participant` screen or the `Edit` button while viewing a participant, NES enters the edition mode.

You can see that the bottom right buttons changed their descriptions to allow you to save new information, and that the `Delete` button on the bottom left was removed:

You can then include new information or change the existing information. Errors found are presented for correction (in red).

After entering new informations, you may click the *Save* button to save them and leave the edition mode.
