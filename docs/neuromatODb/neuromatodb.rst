About NeuroMat Open Database
============================

The NeuroMat Open Database is an initiative of `NeuroMat <http://neuromat.numec.prp.usp.br/>`_ to provide an open-access platform for sharing and searching data and metadata from neuroscience experiments. The platform is constituted by a web portal and a REST (Representational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface). The web portal is being designed to be a user-friendly interface for the neuroscience community to the NeuroMat open-access database. The REST API is used to feed the open database with experimental data generated by the NeuroMat's researchers. Currently, the API intermediates the receiving and retrieving of data from research laboratories which use Neuroscience Experiments System (NES). But the API can be easily adapted to receive (or transfer) data from (for) other client systems.
